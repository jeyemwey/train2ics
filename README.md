# Problem

Get relevant information for your train while just watching in your calendar. Every train you take will have it's own event.

This Application requires **PHP 7**. You might experience errors when running any lower version of PHP.

# Why

German podcaster @timpritlove raged about calendar apps and the German railway company DB the other day and well.. Why not?

# Uses

* Eluceo's iCal library to create events and calendars

If I'll ever send this to you as a letter of application - be happy, I survived that far!
My code might not be the yellow of the egg, but in doubt just blame PHP for it's language design.
Please don't be so rude to me.
